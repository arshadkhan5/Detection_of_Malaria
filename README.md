## what is vgg19 model
  VGG19 is a variant of VGG model which in short consists of 19 layers (16 convolution layers, 3 Fully connected layer, 5 MaxPool layers and 1 SoftMax layer).
  There are other variants of VGG like VGG11, VGG16 and others. VGG19 has 19.6 billion FLOPs.
  VGG as a successor of the AlexNet but it was created by a different group named as Visual Geometry Group at Oxford's and hence the name VGG
 
 
## What is Transfer Learning
